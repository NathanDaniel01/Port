                        Hello, my name is Nate and I am a    
                        creative individual with a strong passion 
                        for graphic design, computer science, and the great outdoors. 
                        With a background in art and design, I have always been drawn to the
                        world of graphic design and love using my skills 
                        and creativity to create visually appealing and 
                        effective designs. In addition to my love for
                        design, I am also a front end web Developer
                        and enjoy learning and exploring 
                        new technologies and programming languages.
                        When Iâ€™m not busy designing or coding, you can      
                        often find me enjoying the great outdoors and
                        all that nature has to offer.
