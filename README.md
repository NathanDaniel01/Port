-- i like this:  Implement later: 
Highlight the ways you’re staying inspired and learning. What books have you read recently? Listening to a good design podcast? What have you been into on Spotify  -- API?--? This is a great opportunity to show everyone you care about growing and add a personal touch. Keep this up to date though. Don’t let it go stale.
